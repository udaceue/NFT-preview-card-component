### Useful resources

- [Css Em/Rem units ](https://medium.com/@hossam.hilal0/rem-vs-em-units-in-css-96d5ac15878e) - This helped me with units that give me flexibility for sizes to be based on the font sizes defined higher up in markup. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

 -[Responsive Web Design ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQraviuwbzU) - "Before you write a single line of code, your website is responsive" - ​​this quote helped me think in the rwd way. I just realized that I should use minimal code and changes to make my apps responsive
